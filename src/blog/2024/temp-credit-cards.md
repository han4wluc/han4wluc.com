Credit Cards is an obsolete product by any standards. Yet they have the highest global network by any standards. Yet today's network companies are the largest fintech companies by any metrics.

There are 335 million merchants in the world. 44 million merchants accept Visa, 37 million accept MasterCard, 31 million accept AMEX, and 30 million accept Discover. Keep in mind, if a merchant accepts one type of credit card, they frequently accept multiple types. It can be estimated that about 15% of businesses globally accept credit cards.



This is a love and hate rant about credit cards.
First of all, I am a credit card user, I have a couple of credit cards from Singapore.
Also, I am reseraching to use credit cards as a merchant, looking for a payment gateway.
I've been researching into credit cards as a merchant for a while, and learn more about them, the reason why my research got long was because I could not find a solution for my needs, in this post I will explain why.
Discalaimer, is I've not worked with any acquirer or bank isntitution, so a lof of my understanding is based on online research and induction. 

Credit Card Network
Acquirer
Card Issuer
Payment Processor
Merchant
User


Credit Card companies such as mainly network companies. We need to understand first what a network is and why it is relevant.

We introduce what is the acquirer and what is the bank institution, and what are their incentives.

And finally we introduce the user.

History of where credit cards started in the first place.

Now that we understand this, let's see how pricing works.

User gets a discount for using credit cards. rewards or whatsoever.
Acquirer gets money for every spend
Bank gets money for every spend
Merchant pays money for every spend

The pay for merchants looks like this for online and offline.

Observations:
* it seems that the merchant is the one paying. afterall they are getting a service. But actually, the merchant will raise its prices, and the ones actually paying are the people paying withotu credit cards.
* 


Plain text credentials.

It is really funny thing. I'm sure there are many cybersecurity experts inside and that work with the credit card companies. However what is the point of that if you can't fix the core of your product?

Walking with a credit cards is essentially same as: ...

3DS seems to be the solution to it. However:
* not enabled to all transactiosn (seems some small transactions don't need authentication)
* sometimes it requires additional fees


Phase 1:

Every country or region to implmeent their own e-ewallet. This e-wallets will be connected to the local banks, whatever, this will bring digitalize the userbase. This is great. Mostly they operate with a QR code.
Now, the issue is 2:
* The e-wallets don't operate with each other.
* This is espeically painful if you're trying to collect payments globally. But I guess that is what Payment gateways are there for.

Phase 2:
* Interoperabilyty of e-wallets. This is usually by country. Where SGQR, PHQR, Linkaja/QRIS. Now, one QR code has solved the  issue from user perspective. Similar soluion needed for the merchants.

Phase 3:
* Connect E-Wallets globally. We've seen regional initiatives:

* DuitNow, PayNow
* Aliplay Plus
* Payment Gatways

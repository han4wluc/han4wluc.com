## Diary

There are a lot of things that happen that I don't make into a blog post. Not any particular reason, just that I didn't feel or find an article to do it. So instead I can put them here in the year recap. Sometimes it will be just be 1 sentence reference.

This is mixed with personal life and work. Because life and work is one.

I never had a habit of writing a diary. However I hope from this post as being the first one, I will write one each year.

First of all, financially it has been the worst year.

2024 end of Jan, there was a layoff from Xendit. I was one of the many who was affected.
For me, I have to say, it is a good thing. I had stayed in Xendit for almost 3 years. Longer than any work position I ever had, I think my preivous longes was less than 2 years.
You usually work for money or for learning. The learning aspect has really dropped for me at Xendit. I was the most senior member in the team, and there is very limited work across teams. So I could hardly find anyone to learn from. I did learn something about managent, but not much improvement in technical terms.
I was considering other jobs anyways, but again I don't think I could have found a good job, especially one that would offer work visa in Singapore.
Severance package enough to get started.

Jokingly, I think the layoff at big tech is a big contributor to founders starting startups haha.

I was so ready before the layoff. Layoff was on a Monday. On Wednesday, I choose my accountant and incorporation secretary to start having my company incorporated.
Due to some admin issues, it took a bit longer, but by xxx I submitted my new EP application which luckly was approved without issues.

So, the first hurdle was completed. Now me and my family can stay in Singapore. The EP lasts 2 years.

In terms of revenue and is a disaster. But it's ok. I've setup enough savings to aim for the long run. There are still some things I want to do before focusing on revenue and income.

I'm working around 12 - 14 hours per day.

1st thing I had to get out of my head. I also wanted a layout framework that was easier to use than flexbox. I did some experimentation and got something working. I originally built a visual editor and VS Code extension, but still too fragile to be used for produciton. So I focused in the library itself.
It is working for me.


Wisdom teeth removal in SG would be 1200 SGD for one tooth. in China is 1.5k rmb, about 300 SGD. It pays for all flight tickets by doing it in China and got to visit family.


* The Generative Beings. This is an interesting event. But i've been only once, and don't plan to go. I need to stay home and do my work.

* Halogen. So, I had done a couple of volunteerings in 2023. Where I would go to a school and act as a corporate mentor. There was an event.

* Apart Research. Effective Altuirsm, but I don't get into that for now... There is a whole different communities out there. Less Wrong. EA forum.

* Build for Good mentorship. But this always get me thinking, could we do this in Italy?

* Chesherie Cat. Roma. I had enough that there is little AI and startup from Italy, and up to to day there is no uniform from Roma. I've had enough of this, and we're going to build Italy what France has done for Mistral. I'm gonna play a part on this. I'm the worst example since I have left Italy and don't live in Italy. But it does not matter, I will contribute in the way I can contribute.

* I started to learn more about Stocks and investing in the public market. I'm investing a small amount, not to become rich but more for the learning. It is interesting, and it could easily be a fulltime job to catch up with the financial news and analyzie all the stocks out there.
I learned about different REITs. Data center REITs.
I learned about interest rates and how to actually buy US gov Treasure Bills. Actually, just buying US Gov T Bills instead of putting in my bank's fixed deposit already gives a bit higher yield.


Take aways

Learning #1

I was ready in terms of how to get my visa, but not on the project or business side.
I was too unprepared to start my own project. 
That is because I did not have any side projects during my fulltime job.
I wish I would have dedicated less nights for my day job and use it for some side project instead. I mean time was not the only issue, also willpower and motivation for side project.

In a more ideal scenario, I would have I working on a side project for 1 year before the layoff. I would have been able to pick up my business much more quicker.

What about my job? I think time was not the main limit for the output. The main limit for output what the things that we worked on. I would timebox my time working, so that I have motivation to spend that time most efficiently.


Learning #2

Never stop novelty search. Serendipity. This one at least I got some returns. I wanted to learn something new from volunteering. And it brought me to the discover of Formal Axiology and Robert Hartman.
I was in a fulltime job, but I did take time out to do volunteering even if it was unclear for me what it would bring be. I'm not saying it will alwasy succeed, I attended events without much returns, and other volunteering with Better.sg but did not bring as much home. However it is necessary to have some activity. No matter how busy, keep some time for trying out new things and activities.

Learning #3

I've been working in startup and in one way or other we prioritize business over technology. During this year isntead, I let my scope run unconttrolled and focus on exploration and innovation and not on any short term returns. The result is mixed. I'm buildling libraries and tech i'm proud of. However withotu doing any marketing, this is zero market zero final value. I have to find the right balance. But this year I was able to explore technologies and how to work with techonologies in a more pure way. Which I hope will set me for a strong foundation for the future. For example I believe I have solved frontend. And I plan to use this frontend until the end of the web.


Wishes for 2025

I need to get out and run with one core business. Enough of foundation building, it has its use, but now we need to go to the market.

I want to keep having side projects outside the core business. They are like plants. Need to plant the seeds earlier.

I need to find a way to grow the projects faster. This might be like finding collaborators, hiring interns or employees to work on them.

I want to continue serendipity. Will participate to more events.

I want to build more professional relationships.

I want to start a mentorship program and hopefully get someone in. This contributes to the serendipity and relationship building.

I definitively want to keep on writing. It has been very hard for me to do writing. Need to keep more.

Learn to use AI. I have more things I want to do that I can do, I have many unfinished projects and idea. Many of the things I do not have enough time, in theory they can be partially or fully solved with AI.

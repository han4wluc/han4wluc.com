# Why solving harder problems can lead to higher ROI?

Should you be solving an easy or hard problem?

Why does this question matter in the first place?

Well, in the context of startups or more generally what you work on in your life, choosing the right problem or thing to work on is more important than the solution.
Not only for startups, but similar is what you do in life in general, such as what to study and what job to get.
One thing to consider when choosing a problem is how hard this problem is.

> One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days

On my first startup, there was a period I was interested in solving easy problems.
I was greatly influenced by lean startup methodology and pareto principle.

My interpretation of lean startup was to do quick experimentation, all resource to spend on building features with the objective to test it out with the users. A hard problem would mean that we would have needed to invest much more resources to develop a solution and therefore we could conduct fewer experients.
A pareto principle inspired me to build 20% of the solution, and I could solve 80% of the problem. Which would have been a good start to validate the solution.
So we did iterate fast, we liked that.
Anything that would have taken longer time to solve such as 1 month, we would have probably chosen not to do it. A 1 month work would mean to spend the whole company resource on it and during that month we coould not do anything else. So we would not have done it unless it was our whole bet.
What we ended up is we did a lot of easy things. Some accumulated, but most of it was thrown away.

One reason is that I valued easy problem and heard problem as the same value.
I viewed easy problems as higher ROI, because the investment was lower, therefore higher ROI.

To be fair, even during this period, there was the engineer in me who enjoyed solving challenging problems. but I felt that from business perspective had problems would not lead to much business value in terms of ROI. I did take pride in solving hard problems in the fasterst way possible.

Luckly my cofounder reminded me that, we are not here to do an e-commerce or validated business.
We were to be a startup which builds an innovative solution. I understood that startups we were up for big challenges, but I did not know how to think about it in terms of ROI.
I understood that solving hard problems was more rewarding, but could not figure out the economics of it.

Well, that was the younger me. Currently, after maybe 7 years, I have come with different perspectives or at least more concious about easy and hard problems.

One day, I came to the quote by JFK: 'we do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard'.
The context of this speech was to justify the moon project.
But in this context from this full speech (link to NASA video speech at Rice), it was more justified as doing greatness, as explorers, responding to challanges.
The context is different for me, but it still got me thinknig why do peple work on hard problems? Is it just for self satisfaction and challanges?
I wanted to explain why solve harder problems in terms of ROI.
But, based on my previous belief, that easier problems have higher ROI, why would we solve harder problems? other than the satisfaction of challenge?

It turns out there is a reason, and I will explain you why. Basically, it turns out harder problem also have higher returns. therefore the ROI can be higher. It is just higher returns and high investment.

However, we can dig a bit deeper to understand that better as well.

Another day, I came through a post which gave me more thiking road

> One of my startup idea filters was to pick problems that take about 1.5-3 years to solve well. If it takes less, then you have no moat (or people already tried and it was a bad idea). If it takes longer, then you're going to run out of money. Estimating this is hard! (esp in AI)
https://x.com/bernhardsson/status/1805047481195016590

Now, this was a good way to put it, and gave me enough material to develop this concept more.
They keyword was "If it takes less, then you have no moat (or people already tried and it was a bad idea)"

My interpretation is there are economic forces of supply and demand playing in here:

We have a graph with problems.

y axis is how hard the problem is
x axis is how valuable is to solve this problem

hard
|---------------
|       |
|   1   |  2
|---------------
|       |
|   3   |  4
|---------------
               valuable


1: Hard problems that are not so valuable. low Returns, high Investment
2: Hard problems that are valuable to solve. high Returns, high Investment
3: Easy problems that are not valuable to solve. low Returns, low Investment
4: Easy problems that are valuable to solve. high Returns, low Investment

So in my young self, I was trying to solve for quadrant 4 and 3 It looked like the one with highest ROI.
Now the problems, is that what is easy for you is probalby easy for everyone else as well. What is hard for you is probably hard for everyone else as well.

Basically, if you solve for easy problems, you are in a market with a lot of competitors, or you can think of many suppliers.
If you pick a harder problem, and able to solve it, you an in a market with much less suppliers, therefore less competition.

Thefore, if you are able to solve a really hard problem. You position yourself in the market as one of the few suppliers.
Quadrant 1, in fact I would call it a niche market, and therefore you can still be profitable.
Quadrant 2, in fact will have more suppliers than quadrant 1, because of the higher perceived value. but still a lucrative market because fewer players than the demand.
Quadrant 3, may be a small niche market, but still with many suppliers
Quadrant 4, may be a overcrowded market, with many suppliers. competitive. but because there is so much demand as well, it can still be profitable although with limits

In order to survive the competition, startups might as well aim for quadrant 1 and 2 as there is much less competition. Once you are in this market, you can charge a premium price.

Ok. we now we understand why harder problems can lead to higher ROI.

Now how hard of a problem should you be picking? 
If you're considering startup, you must be someone who loves challenges.
And I showed you an economics justification for why harder problems can have a higher ROI.
Now, the answer the harder the problem, the better.
Just that the harder the problem, the higher the risk.

This also explains why startups want to solve for the hard problems, they need capital investments.
Different from a more traditional business such as a restaurant, or retail or ecommerce shop where they work more on the quadrant 3 and 4.


Ok, I put this as in the ideal world, to make the environment for the theory. In the real world, things that are hard for some people, are easier for others. And this is where your competitive advantage or unfair advantage comes to play.


We all have finite resources and time, if we run out of time or money, then game is over.

To maximize the rewards, we should pick the hardest and most abitious and challenging out there.
Some examples:

OpenAI: Achieve AGI
SpaceX: Colonization of Mars
UN: eradicate poverty

Ok, those are hard problems to solve, the companies should have run out of money already? It turns out you can break the big problem into smaller ones or stepping stones.


History SpaceX

* Proof that they can launch rockets to orbit
* Proof that they can launch reusable rockets
* Make money by launching reusable rockets to put satellites on
* Test the xxxxxx

Look at how beautiful it is that each milestone is moving closer to the bigger problem. Each milestone also is helping the company building credibility, either by raising more capital or even making revenue already.
Please note well however, that if the SpaceX's 3rd rocket launch had failed, it would havel likely been game over already. Hard problems do come with risk.


Similar with OpenAI

* A lot of reserach in advancing AI such as image recognition, etc...
* ChatGPT
* Sora

The invention of those technologies is making closer to achieving the final goal
And it also products like ChatGPT are generating revenue for the company to keep sustaining itself and re-investing in the goal.


As the long term mission, you should pick the hardest of problems worrying less about its feasibility.
In the shorter term strategical objective, you should have shorter term goals that are more achievable and move closer to the mission and able to generate revenue for the company to sustain itself.

As software engineer or people working in startup and technology, we take for granted that we love challanges and hard problems. And indeed it has higher rewards. maybe already showen by the salary of software engineers or stock prices of tech companies.
Maybe this also somewhat explains why engineers have higher wage than average, and tech companies seems to be doing good in the stock market.
This groups of people are attracted in solving hard problems, which by nature puts them into a position with low supply and therefore can command a better price.

Another reason why picking hard problem works out is:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law

If you pick an easy problem. you will work until the easy problem is solved.
If you pick a hard problem. you will work until the hard problem is solved.

Another nature that goes in is that I think humans beings tend to underestiamte their potential and overestiamte the difficulty of hard problems.
By picking hard problems and comitting to it, you can achieve higher goals, similar to how setting ambitious goals work.
It is kind of a self-fullfilling prophecy.
The harder the problem you set, the harder problems you will be able to solve. As far as ROI is concerned, you are only setting a higher R, while I stays relativley the same.

So, to conclude:
In this article, we have explored that:

* Given all problems give the same returns, it appears that solving the easiest problems lead to higher ROI
* Because easy problems are in high supply, and hard problem in low supply, solving hard problems can lead you to high ROI

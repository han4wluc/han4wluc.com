Designing a great product

Instead of doing a book review, let's give us an objective and see how the concepts of this book can help us reaching the objective.

My objective is to build a great product. I'm willing to spend or invest time for this as long as the outcome of the product is really great. I don't want the outcome to be mediocre product. I want a great product. I prefer to have 1 great product rather than 10 mediocre products. 
One thing for a great product is that it should have a great impact, and to some extent longevity which is closely connected to its great impact. A product that has longer longevity is inherently more impactful over a longer period of time.
If the great product takes 1 year to build, and mediocre product takes 1 month to build. We are still prefer to build the great product.

So, in the end, it comes down to this, investing months or years on one goal to build a great product. My success and whether my goal and objective has been achieved will be on judged and evaluated on whether I have been successful.
There is a premise here, that marketing will be done by its own for the great product. Building the best product is in itself the best marketing.
People are willing to pay for a great and superior product. This is a business requirements so that it makes this cycles sustainable. The money will be able to give more resources to build the product and therfore become an even better product. And create more great products in the future.

I'll break down the phases of building the product into 2.
1. Designing a great product
2. Implement and build and operate the actual product

Let's focus on 1. Designing a great product. 


## Choosing the product to build or rather a starting point

This is a really important thing to decide, yet not so obvious.
If you have a job, this decision may not be to the designer, it may come from a business need.
Choose which problem and area to work on.
Decide on the solution to this problem or area.
Design does not happen in a vacuum. It happens in the context of the world, or rather what existing availalbe solutions or habits already exists out there.

Pick something to start the design journey first, it is not the end.


## Exploration and learning phase

You always have to have an undertanding of the current context for a good design. 




Of course time is not unlimited, but let's give us a couple of years to build it.

So, how do we build a great product? How do we design it, and how do we design the design process to build a great product?

When you're starting a project. You don't know the requiremnts of the thing that you want to build. You will need some exploration and some design to better come up with the requiremtns.
That is why, it is often better to have a vision, or a problem that you want to solve instead of the requirements. The requirements may change rapidly depending on learning, but the vision and problem are less likely to change.

Ok. so now we come up with a vision and/or a problem statemenet. We can explore then how to solve this and start our design.
The issue here is, how do we design for it? From what angle do we start? At this point we are more in an exploration phase, we need to explore different solutions, try different things and learn.
During this exploration phase, we are actually starting to learn more about the problem and we start to understand more about the requiremetns and what actually we want to build.
One important thing to do is to add constrants. This gives focus. Otherwise the search space is too big.

So, there is this co-evolution of the problem and solution. The more you explore the solution, you better understand the problem, and by adjusting the problem, you need to come with a different solution.

In code and software engineering, how does it work.
The first time you design or implement something, this is actually for exploration. This might not the version we use in production.
This is why when we usualy have a urge to rewrite something, it is because we shippeed the 1st version. If we were to design and implmeent it again, we coudl implement a better version. This is true for this time as well. So, after implmeenting a 1st version. Look again and check if maybe you would re-write a better version for the production.

Why so many design are designed by 1 or two 2 people. and Design by consensus often leads to bad outcomes.
The communication overhead is real.
Design consistency is harder withne more people are involved.


> We Donâ€™t Really Know the Goal When We Start
The most serious model shortcoming is that the designer often has a vague, incompletely specified goal, or primary objective. In such cases:
The hardest part of design is deciding what to design.

When you have an idea of something you want, you design it and build it.
There are many things going on there let's break it down.

Let's say you wanted to have a chair. The reality is that you don't know 100% the thing that you want. You just have an initial idea.
The first time we try to design it, we start to be more explicit of what we want, the design process forces us to make decisions. When we are forced to make decision, we ask ouself what we want.

* The thing that we want is changing while we are designing. This is because the design process if forcing us to make decisions.
* While we're chaning what we want, we also will have to change the design. so there is this co-evolution going on.

However, the good thing, is that going through this process:
* we're learning more about what exactly we want
* we're exploring different design approaches and see which approach is working better.
* we're learning more about the constraints and this leads back to chaning what we are building

Trying different designs, is a bit algorithmic.
A design is just an estimate of a real thing.
One could search the design tree at random, but experienced designers have more experiene and based on their experience, can better filter by the decisions that have historically worked better.
On rare occasions, many desingers will have negleted soething because of their experience.
In ideal world we would go through all the design decisions, but in real world, it is practically impossible.
Logging down design deicsions and motivations might be useful.

While implementing, we start to realize the differences between the design and the real thing. If differences are not significant and impactful, that is good. If differences are significant, we may need to re-evaluate if the design decisions were still valid. If it is not valid, then we have to go back and check if this design still makes sense or need to change.
Therefore it becomes important to validate those designs that can be risky by testing it early.

When we see something that is a great product, or great design. What do we do?
The design was an elegant solution to all the constraints.

The design was a good representation of the real thing.



Waterfall model, learn about the problem and solution while designing and implelmenting
First version a throwaway version.


Co evolution


Team design, design consistency. small teams thrive.


Iterating over design tree.


Designing with constraints


Design to study existing design


Design exists in a context, and to some extent you need to know what is going on with the world right now, and what are the user's habits. and trends.

Sometimes it may be useful to start the design from an existing one rather than from scratch and re-inventing the wheels.

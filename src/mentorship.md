# han4wluc's Mentorship program

Hi, nice to meet you.
If you like my work or some of the writing I have done, and have ambitious ideas, I could be our mentor.

## How it works

* There is no fee for the mentorship
* We meet remotely with a videocall on a regular basis
* Most of our work should be done asyncronously, via chat, documents, code reviews etc...
* I'm looking for mentees who have ambitious ideas and vision for a better world whaterver your domain is
* My role as a mentor is to fill in the gap between your ambitious idea and your current abilities/skills
* I don't teach you the skills that you need to learn. I guide you so that you can learn those skills by yourself.
* The length of the mentorship totally depends on the project and what is current progress. Let's default the mentorship length to 3 months, but adapt it to you needs and the project.

## What I'm looking for

* I'm looking for people with ambitious ideas and vision for better world. Most potential.
* I'm looking for candidates that are committed, enthusiastic, and have the will to work towards such vision.
* The skills you currently have does not matter os much, i'm here to fill in those gaps
* I'm mostly experienced in software, digital products and applications, design, startups, innovation. But I'm open to projects in any domain.

## Ideal candidate

* This mentorship is heavily biases towards younger candidates. Ideal candidate is a student, but this is not a strict requirement. Candidates from all ages are welcome to apply but know that there is a bias towars younger candidates.
* You have some project you want to do, but you don't know where to start of feel lacking the skills to do it
* You are able to commit and find time work on the project during the period of the mentorship
* I'm hoping to spend a few hours a week for the mentorship for myself, you should definitvely be spending more than that.


## What a successful mentorshipo looks like

* At the end of the mentorship, you should feel that you can learn and do anything. The main constraint of what is possible is mostly time.
* The project has taken more concrete shape and you know where to go from here
* Keep in touch, less regularly. But enough so the relationship does not die out, but can be activated when needed.


## Why

* It gives me an opportunity to give back. Giving back is how the world works, and can't not do it.
* Gives me exposure to you. Learn from you, learn from youger people
* Building relationship that can benefit me in the long run



## Proccess

* Submit a project proposal
* I will assess the proposal and get back to you within 1 week. I might ask you for further information if necessary
* Video interview sessions for me to get to know more about the project and learn about you
* We will trial mentorship with a couple of sessions before committing for a longer period.
